# FBI_Time_Series_Analysis
As data transforming industries, using machine learning to support public safety and urban planning has become increasingly valuable. In this project, I explored the use of machine learning to predict crime incident counts based on historical crime data. The core objective was to build a predictive model that could help estimate the number of incidents for specific crime types over time, potentially aiding authorities in resource allocation and crime prevention. The project involved working with two main datasets:

1.A training dataset in .csv format containing past crime records with columns such as YEAR, MONTH, TYPE, and Incident_Counts.

2.A test dataset in .xlsx format with detailed information about crime events, including geolocation (Latitude, Longitude), time (HOUR, MINUTE, DAY), and neighborhood information.

This model is to predict the number of crime incidents based on historical data, helping law enforcement and city planners allocate resources efficiently, enhance public safety, and support data-driven decision-making.

This Model shows excellent overall fit and predictive power, as indicated by the very high RÂ² score of 0.96. This suggests it captures the trends and patterns in your data effectively.
